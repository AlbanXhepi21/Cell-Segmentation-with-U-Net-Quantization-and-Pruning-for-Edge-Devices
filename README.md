# Cell Segmentation with U-Net: Quantization and Pruning for Edge Devices

## Description

This GitHub repository hosts the code and resources for my master's thesis project on cell segmentation using the U-Net architecture. The project focuses on developing a robust segmentation model capable of accurately delineating cell boundaries, with a specific emphasis on deploying the model efficiently on edge computing devices.

## Key Features

- Implementation of U-Net architecture for cell segmentation using PyTorch.
- Annotation tools and scripts for preprocessing the THP1 dataset, a unique collection of unannotated cellular images.
- Training pipeline with options for data augmentation and optimization techniques.
- Integration of quantization and pruning techniques to reduce the model size for deployment on edge devices.
- Evaluation scripts and metrics for assessing the segmentation performance and computational efficiency of the optimized model.

## Contents

- **Code:** Contains the source code for implementing the U-Net model, data preprocessing, training procedures, and model optimization.
- **Data:** Includes the THP1 dataset along with scripts for data preprocessing and augmentation.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation on how to use the codebase, including setup instructions, usage examples, and explanations of key functions and modules.
- **Results:** Provides visualizations and analysis of segmentation results, performance metrics, and comparisons with baseline models.
- **Resources:** Supplementary materials such as research papers, tutorials, and relevant articles used in the development of the project.
